You should see MySQLWorkbench under `Applications`


## Guidelines for Catalina

The current version of mysqlworkbench (8.0.23) for Catalina at time of writing (June 2021) is 8.0.23 which appears to be buggy for certain updates of Catalina. Dropping down one version to 8.0.22 worked for me as follows.

If already installed then remove first.

```bash
brew uninstall --cask mysqlworkbench
```

Download formula for 8.0.22.

```bash
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jonjack/de51fb456c7682cbfd55314669d6513c/raw/4b70352469035a2e35818f2c1fff0e1cb1bbec89/mysqlworkbench-8.0.22.rb
```

Now install.

```bash
brew install --cask mysqlworkbench-8.0.22.rb

## Big Sur

There is also a formula here which will install v8.0.25 compatible with Big Sur.

```bash
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jonjack/84e24ed5f44e452e629cfe01cf472267/raw/987362b8bd554b49ecc136213321d5f27c89efb0/mysqlworkbench-8.0.25.rb
